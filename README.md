## CSS 3D Foldable Card Hover Effect

I did this practice a few months ago to review some 3d concepts in CSS like 3d preservation, perspective and back-face visibility.
I hope you enjoy watching it just like I enjoyed coding from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDy2UptgdUY).

This is pure HTML and CSS ONLY!!

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otCSS3DFoldableCardHoverEffects/) !
